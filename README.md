EE488 Introduction to Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is to implement feedforward neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using TensorFlow. In this project you have to implement feedforward neural network and
LSTM network. First you will design a feedforward neural network using MNIST dataset. After that you will implement cross-entropy loss function without using built-in-function. Second you will
implement LSTM network using stock market data. In this part you will implement MSE without using built-in-function.
